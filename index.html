  <h1>Special Forces Packing Lists</h1>

  <p>       Hello, I recently finished the course, this is something I wish I would have had while going through. <br>
            We're looking to make it more streamlined and add all courses in the pipeline <br>
            We're using amazon for ease of use and because they have virtually everything and at better prices than you'll find on yadkin.<br>
            We're working to find other vendors to fulfill everything amazon cannot.<br>
            *We make a small commission at no cost to you on products you purchase through our links <br>
            **BEST TO SHIP TO A RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS OR TO A UPS STORE FOR PICKUP**<br>
            If you have suggestions or quesions please email me at:<br>charliechopapa@gmail.com <br>  
             Packing lists are below. Will update as frequently as possible.</p>
